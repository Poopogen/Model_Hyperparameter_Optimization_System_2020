# Auto-Optimization_System_2020
This repository features a system designed to simplify and automate hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. Users can plan and select hyperparameters for time-series model training, avoiding the need to repeatedly enter commands when making changes.

System Features:
- Streamlined Training Process: Customize and train models efficiently without redundant manual inputs.
- Automation and Flexibility: Automatically adjusts and trains based on selected hyperparameters.

  
Outputs:
1. Training Results (stored in /Output_files):
- Learning Curves: /Output_files/Plot
- Saved Models: /Output_files/ModelSaved

3. Prediction Results (stored in /Prediction/output)

4. AI Explainability (SHAP Value Plots stored in /Prediction/shap)


This system is ideal for researchers and engineers seeking an efficient solution for model training, evaluation, and explainability.
