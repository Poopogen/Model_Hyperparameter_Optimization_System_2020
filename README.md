# Auto-Optimization_System_2020
This repository features a system designed to simplify and automate hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. Users can plan and select hyperparameters for time-series model training, avoiding the need to repeatedly enter commands when making changes.

System Features:
- Streamlined Training Process: Customize and train models efficiently without redundant manual inputs.
- Automation and Flexibility: Automatically adjusts and trains based on selected hyperparameters.

  
Outputs:
1. Training Results including learning curves and saved models (stored in /Output_files)
2. Prediction Results including result plots and excel files (stored in /Prediction/output)
3. AI Explainability (sHAP value Plots stored in /Prediction/shap):
